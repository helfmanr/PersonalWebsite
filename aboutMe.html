                     I am currently a 4th year Computer Science major at Washington University in St. Louis. My education at Washington University has given me a strong engineering background and enhanced my programming skills. I first started coding with Java, which promotes a good foundation of object-oriented programming. In my data structures and algorithms course, I analyzed conceptual ideas and integrated them with my knowledge of Java to develop practical algorithms; for example identifying an efficient sort for a given data set. I have also have taken courses in web and mobile development. From this I have gained experience in Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

                    The last two summers I have interned at Symantec Corporation. In both summers, I was involed in projects related to iOS. In the last, I actually helped develop an iOS application. Apple released Swift, a new development language for iOS and OS X, during WWDC 2014. During my summer internship I investigated Swift and used it to develop the iOS application. Coming into this summer without significant experience working with Objective-C, I saw a great opportunity to develop this app in Swift. So in preparation, for the first couple weeks of my internship I studied Swift and created a few practice applications in the language. Since Swift had only just been released, developing in the language was an exciting and worthwhile challenge. After becoming sufficiently familiar with the new language, I began developing the application  My boss also arranged for my partner and I to hold an “Introduction to Swift” session. During the presentation, we demonstrated how Swift syntax and key features are modern and powerful. This was a great opportunity to improve my public speaking skills in front of my fellow Symantec employees.

                     In the first summer, I was given the project of developing automated test scripts that would examine the user interface of our team’s product and discover defects for an iOS application. I first created a framework, in a program called Squish, such that the test scripts would be clear & concise and to increase the feasibility of adding more test scripts in the future. The scripts were written in Python, progressing my object-oriented programming skillset, and greatly improved the process of finding defects for the user interface.
